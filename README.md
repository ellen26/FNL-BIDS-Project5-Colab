# NIH
repo for NIH summer project

Goal:
1: Understand how to connect Github (open source) to Google Colab
2: Compare usage between two platforms

Two Github provided by professor: 
https://github.com/ravichas/ML-TC1 (Machine Learning)
https://github.com/ravichas/ML-predict-drugclass (Deep Learning)

Using Google Colab, it only takes one step to link with Github. 
For example: 
Original Github notebook link: https://github.com/ravichas/ML-predict-drugclass/blob/master/predict-drugclass.ipynb
Change to Colab link:  https://colab.research.google.com/github/ravichas/ML-predict-drugclass/blob/master/predict-drugclass.ipynb
Create a text box and put in the colab link into it.
Then when you click on it, it will show as ML.ipynb in this repo. 
The link for that page will change to: https://colab.research.google.com/github/ravichas/ML-predict-drugclass/blob/master/predict-drugclass.ipynb#scrollTo=Sj8qV5neKSd1

Performance: 
Overall, Google Colab performs really well in using and linking Github resources. Even though for some graphs, their size need to be resize. It does not need to rerun the code to see the outputs, but if you need to make changes to code you need to download every data and packages included in original Github's notebook.
